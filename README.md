# Welcome to my chess app
This project is me migrating (and completing) an 85% complete Chess GUI project in Java that I made a little while ago to Javascript/React for a more friendly and accesible interface. All of the code is my original work, no tutorials followed (general inspiration taken from the React TicTacToe Tutorial).
The end goal is to have a website with a two-player chess interface (currently just being able to have two players play each other on one device).
All pieces designed and digitally created by Jenny Wang.
