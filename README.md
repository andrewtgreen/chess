# Welcome to my chess app
This project is me building a Chess Game in React. No tutorials have been followed for the chess logic or components, inspiration for the user accounts and connectivity across devices taken from [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/@PedroTechnologies).
The end goal is to have a website with a two-player chess interface (currently just being able to have two players play each other on one device).
All pieces designed and digitally created by Ms. Jenny Wang.
